🌆 I'm an Urban Lover
======
I am currently a Master of Architecture student at UC Berkeley with Graduate Certificate in Applied Data Science and Geographical Information Science and Technology. I'm deeply fascinated by how cities move, grow, and breathe. 

My interest lies in:
📍 Transportation infrastructure spatial justice
🌿 Healthy and inclusive cities
⚡ Sustainable energy systems

Through modeling, mapping, and storytelling, I seek to create more inclusive and resilient urban futures.


🍹 I'm a Life Lover
======
In my daily life:
🎹 I love playing piano
🚴‍♀️ Exploring cities by bike
🧋 A true beverage enthusiast—especially making my own milk tea at home
🌶️ Always up for spicy food adventures
